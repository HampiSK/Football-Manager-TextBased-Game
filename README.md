# Football-Manager-TextBased-Game

In this project I'm trying to create simple text based game where you will be playing as a manager of your football team. Right now, the game is in a really raw state so you can get an idea which direction I'm aiming for.

## Future Updates

Unfortunately I'm working on other projects so I don't have time to finish this one. But if you would like to have this game finished just show me your support by following this project :)

### Compile

```
g++ --std=c++11 -g ./Main.cpp
```

Enjoy!
